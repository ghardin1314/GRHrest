              In the begining there was nothing. Then, Python said "Let there be
              data!", and there was data. Well... it wasn't quite that easy. All
              of the data was webscraped from a friendly neighboorhood car
              listing site (where one might "trade autos"). Gathering the data
              came in two parts; finding all of the makes, models, and trims
              with used listings available, and then saving the data for the
              individual listings.

              What are my options?

            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
              I first went to the advance search options page on the site to
              find all my options. My inital idea was to use splinter and just
              cycle through the drop down menu, but that wasn't the most
              reliable and took forever. So, while I was messing around I found
              the internal API calls on while observing the network log on the
              browser console.

            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
              After a bit of fanagling I got the format correct and could
              directly call the API myself. Doing this still took too long so I
              went ahead and added some threading to the code to speed up the
              process, but then I hit the API rate limit while pulling all the
              trims so I had to add some pauses. You win some...

            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
              Next step, aquire the goods. Now that I have all the options to
              pick from, I looped through every make, model, trim combination
              and pulled the listing results. Turns out, you can only go 1,000
              listings deep into the database of the site.{" "}
              <p>
                To get a fully representative data pool, I sorted the cars by
                distance to hopefully get an equal amount of older and newer
                cars. I also through in a splash of threading to speed up the
                process becasue I ain't got time to burn like that.{" "}

            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
              Suprisingly it actually took much longer to write the results to
              the database than to scape them from the site and more suprisingly
              I never hit the API limit during this. Even with the limit of
              results, this was a lot (A LOT!) of data. Somewhere in the
              neighborhood of <b>730,544</b> lisitings (Last scraped 4/15/2020).
              <p>
                When the script finally finished without any errors and I
                realized I effectively pulled all the publicly available data
                from this site I was like:

              Now to do something with all this data. I wanted to see if there
              was an absolute optimal car to buy from a depreciation standpoint.
              Theoretically, this would be where the rate of depreciation is
              changing the least, i.e. where the acceleration of price droping
              is the lowest.

              To do this I needed to get reaquainted with my (not so) good
              friend linear algebra. Since I needed to find the second
              derivative of the price, I knew I would need a cubic surface. This
              meant solving for the following constants using least squares:

              , or finding the smallest envelope that covers the data set.
              <p>
                Luckily for me scipy has a library for that, so it took one line
                of code to find the verticies of the year-miles convex hull.
                What has a little more challenging was testing whether or not my
                minimum curvature point was inside this envelope or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ended up looping through the verticies clockwise and finding
                the cross product of the vector to the optimal point and the
                vector to the next vertex. If this cross product was positive
                for all verticies, the point was inside the envelope. Lastly I
                looped through the minimum curvature points until I found one
                inside my envelope. DONE!
