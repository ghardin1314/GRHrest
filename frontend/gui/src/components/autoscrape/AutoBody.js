            In the begining there was nothing. Then, Python said "Let there be
            data!", and there was data. Well... it wasn't quite that easy. All
            of the data was webscraped from a friendly neighboorhood car listing
            site (where one might "trade autos"). Gathering the data came in two
            parts; finding all of the makes, models, and trims with used
            listings available, and then saving the data for the inidvidual
            listings.

            What are my options?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
            I first went to the advance search options page on the site to find
            all my options. My inital idea was to use splinter and just cycle
            through the drop down menu, but that wasn't the most reliable and
            took forever. So while I was messing around I found the internal API
            calls on while observing the network log on the browser console.
            After a bit of fanagling I got the format correct and could directly
            call the API myself. Doing this still took too long so I went ahead
            and added some threading to the code to speed up the process, but
            then I hit the API rate limit while pulling all the trims so I had
            to add some pauses. You win some...
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom align="left">
            Cars! Cars! Cars!
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
            Next step, aquire the goods. Now that I have all the options to pick
            from, I looped through every make, model, trim combination and
            pulled the listing results. Turns out, you can only go 1000 listings
            deep into the database of the site. To get a fully representative
            data pool, I sorted the cars by distance to hopefully get an equal
            amount of older and newer cars. I also through in a splash of
            threading to speed up the process becasue I ain't got time to burn
            like that.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
            Suprisingly it actually took much longer to write the results to the
            database than to scape them from the site and more suprisingly I
            never hit the API limit during this. Even with the limit of results,
            this was a lot (A LOT!) of data. Somewhere in the neighborhood of ~3
            million lisitings. When the script finally finished without any
            errors and I realized I effectively pulled all the publicly
            available data from this site I was like:
          </Typography>
          <Grid container justify="center">
            <DynamicIFrame src="https://giphy.com/embed/RLWwOuPbqObupogOLB" />

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
            Now to do something with all this data. I wanted to see if there was
            an absolute optimal car to buy from a depreciation standpoint.
            Theoretically, this would be where the rate of depreciation is
            changing the least, i.e. where the acceleration of depreciation is
            the lowest. To do this I needed to get reaquainted with my (not so)
            good friend linear algebra. Since I needed to find the second
            derivative of the price, I knew I would need a cubic surface. This
            meant solving for the following constants using least squares:

          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom align="left">
            Now I could find the theoretical price at any year and milage using:
